## ATM'22 Challenge Collection
This challenge is open-call (challenge opens for new submissions after MICCAI 2022 deadline). The online evaluation for individual algorithms is still working. 

### Registration
The registration information, and detailed information could refer to [**Registration Page**](https://atm22.grand-challenge.org/registration/). 

**NOTE:** All participants must send the signed data agreement to IMR-ATM22@outlook.com for successful registration, as required in [**Registration Page**](https://atm22.grand-challenge.org/registration/). 

### Baseline and Docker Tutorial
We provide a baseline model and a detailed docker tutorial, please refer to: [**Baseline and Docker Example**](https://github.com/Puzzled-Hui/ATM-22-Related-Work/tree/main/baseline-and-docker-example) for detailed instructions.

### Evaluation
The evaluation code is provided in [**Evaluation**](https://github.com/Puzzled-Hui/ATM-22-Related-Work/tree/main/evaluation).
