## Contents

In the `evaluation_atm_22.py`, it includes the calculation of four metrics:
- Tree length detected rate (TD, %)
- Branch detected rate (BD, %)
- Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC, %)
- Precision (%) 
These metrics could also be used in other tubular segmentation tasks.

In addition, the code of parsing the airway tree can refer to the repository of [Alleviating class-wise gradient imbalance for pulmonary airway segmentation](https://github.com/haozheng-sjtu/3d-airway-segmentation).
